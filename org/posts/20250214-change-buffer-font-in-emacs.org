#+TITLE: Change buffer font in Emacs
#+DATE: <2025-02-14 Fri 12:36>

From Emacs 23.1, you can change the font of current buffer, using =buffer-face-set=. You can toggle this using =buffer-face-mode= or =buffer-face-toggle=.

For example, change the font of all org mode buffers when openning:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (buffer-face-set :family "LXGW WenKai Mono" :height 140)))
#+end_src

The argument should be a face name or a property list of face attributes and values. If more than on face is listed, that specifies an aggregate face, like in a face text property. Font face attributes are family, height, weight, slant, etc.
