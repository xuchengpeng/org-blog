#+TITLE: Org Mode Syntax
#+SUBTITLE: Your life in plain text

#+DATE: <2025-01-09 Thu 14:50>

A GNU Emacs major mode for keeping notes, authoring documents, computational notebooks, literate programming, maintaining to-do lists, planning projects, and more â€” in a fast and effective plain text system.

* Basics

** Biggest heading

New chapter.

*** Bigger heading

New section.

**** Big heading

New sub-section.

**** Text breaks

By entering two consecutive backslashes,
you can force to break lines \\
without starting a new paragraph.

For an horizontal line, insert at least 5 dashes: this is some text above an
horizontal rule
-----
and some text below it.

**** Numbered headings

You can create numbered headings up to a certain level by setting an option:

#+begin_src org
,#+OPTIONS: H:4
#+end_src

** Lists

Org markup allows you to create bulleted or numbered lists. It allows any
combination of the two list types.

*** Unordered lists

Itemized lists are marked with bullets. They are convenient to:

- organize data, and
- make the document
  + prettier, and
  + easier to read.

Create them with a minus or a plus sign.

*** Ordered lists

Enumerated lists are marked with numbers or letters:

1. First element
   1) First sub-item
   2) Last sub-item
2. Second element

You can have ordered lists with jumping numbers:

1. [@1] First
2. [@2] Second
5. [@5] Jump to 5th

*** Definition lists

- Definition list ::
     List containing definitions.

- Term to define ::
     Explication of the term.

*** Checkboxes
- [ ] First item not checked
- [-] Second item half done
  - [X] Another first
  - [ ] Another second
- [X] Third item checked

** Miscellaneous effects

*** Include Org files

You can include another Org file and skip its title by using the ~:lines~ argument
to ~#+INCLUDE~:

#+begin_src org
,#+INCLUDE: chapter1.org :lines "2-"
#+end_src

#+begin_note
File inclusion, through INCLUDE keywords, is an export-only feature.
#+end_note

*** Inline HTML

You can include raw HTML in your Org documents and it will get kept as HTML
when it's exported.

#+begin_export html
<pre style="color:red">
Text can be preformatted (in a fixed-width font).
</pre>
#+end_export

#+begin_example
,#+begin_info
,*Info example* \\
Did you know...
,#+end_info
#+end_example

*** LaTeX

You can also use raw LaTeX.

#+begin_src latex
\begin{verbatim}
Text can be preformatted (in a fixed-width font).
\end{verbatim}
#+end_src

*** Centered text

#+begin_center
This text is centered!
#+end_center

** Code blocks

#+begin_src cpp :eval no
/*
 * Application that displays a "Hello" message to the standard output.
 */
int main(int arc, char **argv)
{
  printf("Hello, %s!\n", (argc>1) ? argv[1] : "World");
  return 0;
}
#+end_src

** Notes at the footer

It is possible to define named footnotes[fn:myfootnote], or ones with
automatic anchors[fn:2].

** Formatting text

*** Text styles

Regular text. /Italic text./ *Bold text.* _Underline text._ +Stroke text.+

*** Quotations

Use the ~quote~ block to typeset quoted text.

#+begin_quote
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
#+end_quote

In a ~verse~ environment, there is an implicit line break at the end of each
line, and indentation and vertical space are preserved:

#+begin_verse
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
#+end_verse

*** Details

#+begin_details
#+begin_summary
Here is summary
#+end_summary

Here are details.
- d1.
- d2.

#+begin_src org
,#+begin_details
,#+begin_summary
Here is summary
,#+end_summary

Here are details.
- d1.
- d2.
,#+end_details
#+end_src

#+begin_src css
details {
  margin: 1em 0;
}

details > summary {
  cursor: pointer;
}

details > summary > p {
  display: inline;
}
#+end_src
#+end_details

*** Aside

Here is a paragraph before aside paragraph: Salamanders are a group of amphibians with a lizard-like appearance, including short legs and a tail in both larval and adult forms.

#+begin_aside
Here is aside paragraph: Time flies, enjoy life.
#+end_aside

Here is a paragraph after aside paragraph: Several species of salamander inhabit the temperate rainforest of the Pacific Northwest, including the Ensatina, the Northwestern Salamander and the Rough-skinned Newt. Most salamanders are nocturnal, and hunt for insects, worms and other small creatures.

** Mathematical formulae

You can embed LaTeX math formatting in Org mode files using the following
syntax:

- For *inline math* expressions, use ~\(...\)~: \(x^2\) or \(1 < 2\).

  It's /not/ advised to use the constructs ~$...$~ (both for Org and MathJax).

- Centered display equation (the /Euler theorem/):

  \[
  \int_0^\infty e^{-x^2} dx = {{\sqrt{\pi}} \over {2}}
  \]

  The use of ~\[...\]~ is for mathematical expressions which you want to make
  *stand out, on their own lines*.

  LaTeX allows to inline such ~\[...\]~ constructs (/quadratic formula/):
  \[ \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4 a c}}{2a} \]

  Double dollar signs (~$$~) should /not/ be used.

** Comments

It's possible to add comments in the document.

# This Org comment here won't be displayed.

** Tables

#+CAPTION: An example of table
| Header 1    | Header 2      | Header 3 |
|-------------+---------------+----------|
| Top left    | Top middle    |          |
|             |               | Right    |
| Bottom left | Bottom middle |          |

#+CAPTION: Table with alignment
|      <r> |   <c>    | <l>      |
|        1 |    2     | 3        |
|    right |  center  | left     |
| xxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxx | xxxxxxxx |
