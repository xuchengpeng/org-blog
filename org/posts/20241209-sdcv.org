[[https://github.com/Dushistov/sdcv][sdcv]] is a simple, cross-platform, text-based utility for working with dictionaries in [[https://stardict-4.sourceforge.net/][StarDict]] format.

StarDict dictionaries can be downloaded from https://www.nchrs.xyz/stardict/index.html.

The [[https://github.com/jamescherti/quick-sdcv.el][quick-sdcv]] package serves as a lightweight Emacs interface for the sdcv command-line interface, which is the console version of the StarDict dictionary application.
