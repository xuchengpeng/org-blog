Sometimes you might need to convert a symbol to string in Emacs Lisp. You start looking for functions like =symbol-to-string= and =string-to-symbol= but, they do not exist.

With Emacs Lisp, you can do it like this.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(symbol-name 'some-symbol)
; ==> "some-symbol"
(intern "some-symbol")
; ==> some-symbol
#+end_src
