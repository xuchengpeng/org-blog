#+TITLE: Define Emacs Formatter

Steve Purcell has created a package [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs-reformatter][reformatter]], which can define commands to format the current Emacs buffer.

The =reformatter-define= macro expands to code which generates =xxx-buffer= and =xxx-region= interactive commands, and a local minor mode called =xxx-on-save-mode=. The =:args= and =:program= expressions will be evaluated at runtime, so they can refer to variables that may have a buffer-local value. A custom variable will be generated for the mode lighter, with the supplied value becoming the default.

For example, we can use [[https://github.com/mvdan/sh][shfmt]] to format shell scripts.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'sh-script
  (reformatter-define shfmt
    :program "shfmt"
    :args `("-i" ,(number-to-string sh-basic-offset))))
#+end_src
