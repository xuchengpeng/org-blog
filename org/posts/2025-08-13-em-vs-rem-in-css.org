In CSS, ~em~ and ~rem~ represent relative units that display the scalable and responsive results.

- ~em~: It is relative to the font size of the parent. For example, if a parent font size is 20px, then ~2em~ will equal 40px.
- ~rem~: Itâ€™s relative to root element font size, usually ~<html>~. For example, if root font size is 16px, then ~1rem~ equals 16px.
