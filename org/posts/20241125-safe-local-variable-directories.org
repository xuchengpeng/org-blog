#+TITLE: Safe Local Variable Directories
#+DATE: <2024-11-25 Mon 15:46>

#+BEGIN_PREVIEW
=safe-local-variable-directories= was introduced in Emacs 30.1.

A list of directories where local variables are always enabled.
#+END_PREVIEW

Directory-local variables loaded from these directories, such as the variables in =.dir-locals.el=, will be enabled even if they are risky.

The names of the directories in the list must be absolute, and must end in a slash.

Remote directories can be included if the variable =enable-remote-dir-locals= is non-nil.
