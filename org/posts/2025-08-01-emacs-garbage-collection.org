[[https://gitlab.com/koral/gcmh][gcmh]](aka "Garbage Collection Magic Hack") is useful and easy to handle garbage collection for GNU Emacs.

Enforce a sneaky Garbage Collection strategy to minimize GC interference with the activity. During normal use a high GC threshold is set. When idling GC is triggered and a low threshold is set.
