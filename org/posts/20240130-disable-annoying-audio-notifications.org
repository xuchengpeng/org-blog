#+TITLE: Disable Annoying Audio Notifications
#+DATE: <2024-01-30 Tue 14:29>

#+BEGIN_PREVIEW
By default Emacs ring the bell to attract the user's attention, this is annoying.

To get a visual signal instead, set =visual-bell= with =t= Emacs should flash the screen to represent a bell.

We can also customize =ring-bell-function= to just flash the modeline.
