Executes the given template and caches the result, optionally passing context. If the contains a return statement, returns the given value, else returns the rendered output.

The ~partialCached~ function can offer significant performance gains for complex templates that donâ€™t need to be re-rendered on every invocation.

Here is the simplest usage:

#+begin_src html
  {{ partialCached "footer.html" . }}
#+end_src

Pass additional arguments to ~partialCached~ to create variants of the cached partial. For example, if you have a complex partial that should be identical when rendered for pages within the same section, use a variant based on section so that the partial is only rendered once per section:

#+begin_src html
  {{ partialCached "footer.html" . .Section }}
#+end_src
